      "Haystack is an open-source AI framework developed by deepset AI, designed to help developers build customizable, production-ready applications powered by language models (LLMs), transformer models, and vector search. Here are some key points about Haystack:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Overview and Documentation**: You can find more detailed information on the official Haystack website at [Haystack - deepset AI](https://haystack.deepset.ai/) and its documentation at [Haystack Documentation](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/intro).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Purpose**: Haystack is an end-to-end framework that allows you to build applications using LLMs, Transformer models, and vector search. It is particularly useful for document-centric Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) applications and production-ready retrieval pipelines.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Features**: Haystack offers a modular framework that provides full visibility to inspect, debug, and optimize every decision your AI makes. It helps in managing complexity and focuses more on developing the application logic.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Enterprise Edition**: For those looking for a more enterprise-level solution, there is a Haystack Enterprise Edition available, which provides an AI Orchestration Framework for building production-ready, LLM-powered agents and applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Comparison**: Haystack is often compared with other frameworks like LangChain. According to [Haystack vs LangChain](https://peliqan.io/blog/haystack-vs-langchain/), Haystack is better suited for document-centric RAG applications and production-ready retrieval pipelines, while LangChain is better for complex agentic workflows, multi-step reasoning, and integrating external APIs or tools.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Tutorials and Resources**: There are various tutorials and resources available to help you get started with Haystack. For example, [Haystack AI Tutorial: Building Agentic Workflows](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/haystack-ai-tutorial) provides a detailed guide on how to use Haystack for building agentic workflows.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Video Tutorial**: A video tutorial on YouTube, [Haystack by Deepset - Framework to Build LLM Apps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=th8WpWtxad0), explains how Haystack can simplify the process of building AI applications with language models.\n",
      "\n",

The Artemis II mission, scheduled for 2024, will send astronauts around the Moon for the first time since 1972. The Artemis III mission, planned for 2027, aims to land the first woman and the first person of color on the Moon.\n\n#### Artemis II Mission\n- **Launch Date**: The latest launch date for Artemis II is set for February 2026, with a window of several days each month through April 2026.\n- **Crew**: The crew for Artemis II includes NASA astronauts Christina Koch, Reid Wiseman, and Victor Glover, along with Canadian Space Agency astronaut Jeremy Hansen.\n- **Orion Spacecraft**: The Orion capsule has arrived at the Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) at NASA's Kennedy Space Center, where it will be stacked atop the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket.\n- **SLS Rocket**: The final piece of the Artemis II SLS rocket, the stage adapter, has arrived at Kennedy Space Center. This adapter will connect the Orion spacecraft to the rest of the rocket and carry a set of cubesats during the mission.\n\n#### Artemis III Mission\n- **Delayed**: The Artemis III mission, originally scheduled for late 2025, has been pushed back to at least mid-2027.
